## Objection / Inquiry 1: from prospective customer:
    “My team is too busy fighting fires to evaluate another monitoring tool.”
    - Kate the SRE Manager


## Possible Response:
We always deal with the emergency and do not address the substantive issues.

At one point in my career, I had to manage a maintenance team that was in charge of data flows in the company.
There were always problems, we couldn't meet our SLAs.
The management asked me why it crashes, where it crashes, please fix it and fast.
At the time, we only had few reports from our monitoring tool or we had too much information from the logs and so the people in my team get lost in it.
I was fed up with this situation, so I built my own monitoring tool to synthesize the information and to bring up the KPIs that are important for the management.
It took me many weekends to build this tool but it was worth it because thanks to the dashboards I built, it allowed the management to become aware of where the problems were coming from and to release budgets to treat the errors at the root.
In less than 6 months we were able to meet our SLA.

Why is a good monitoring and reporting tool important?

Because it allows you to identify the real source of problems, because it allows you to have a general view of our infrastructure, because it allows you to direct budgets where it's necessary.

What is a good monitoring and reporting? 

It can be Datadog because DataDog will allow you to get out of the emergency and deal with the root cause of problems.

How does DataDog do it? 

First with a simple installation, no server to create and maintain, a simple agent installation is enough. Then with pre-built reports for more than 400 products on the market and finally the service map tool bring you the possibility to see in real time the whole information system and quickly discover the bottlenecks.

If you don't make this choice, you'll stay in the emergency and you won't treat the problems at the root. 

If you choose to follow up with us, in one afternoon, I can come on site to give you a demo directly from your IS data and present you with turnkey dashboards that will allow you to identify the real source of the problems and be able to achive your SLAs.


## Objection / Inquiry 3: from prospective customer:
    “We’re using a hosted ELK stack and it works well enough. Tell me why Datadog’s log tool is better than what we have today. How can it help us?”

    - Greg the Sr. SRE
  
## Possible Response:
In fact, both solutions are similar and different at the same time.

They are similar because they meet the same objective, which is to monitor applications and an information system.

It is in the achievement of this objective that they differ.

First of all, you host your ELK, whereas DataDog is SaaS. This means that you will have one less infrastructure to manage. 

Then with ELK you have to build your own information extractions with Logstash or Beats (and often many different agents to install). DataDog is a simple and unique agent to install, and as a turnkey solution you have over 400 systems ready to be monitored. You don't have to reinvent the wheel anymore. Your infrastructure will evolve, that's for sure, with ELK you will have to create new streams, with datadog, they will already be supported. 

If you want to make load forecasts on your servers with ELK you will have to use data scientists to build your models. With DataDog, the load forecast is already provided, you don't need to dedicate people to this task.

When you have a problem with the ELK stack, you have to rely on the community forums which are generally best efforts. With DataDog you will have a real professional support.

To sum up, if you don't want to reinvent the wheel every time you have a new application to host in your information system use DataDog. There is a 90% chance that DataDog has already done it, for the remaining 10% we will be there to support you.
